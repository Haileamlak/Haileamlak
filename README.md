# Hi, I'm Haileamlak Belachew! 
A software engineer with a strong foundation in back-end development, mobile applications, and full-stack projects. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Addis Ababa University, and I'm continuously exploring new technologies and frameworks to enhance my skills.

I develop scalable and secure RESTful APIs with Golang and Python, and create cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter. My approach emphasizes clean, maintainable code, leveraging agile methodologies, Clean Architecture, and thorough testing.

I am currently enrolled in an intensive software engineering training program at [A2SV](https://a2sv.org/), where I focus on advanced algorithms, data structures, and back-end software development. This experience has sharpened my problem-solving skills and enhanced my technical communication abilities.

These are the languages and tools I am familiar with.
